### vscode
i have used many ide or code editor, eclipse, itellij(webstorm, android studio), sublime text, and now vscode is my favorite code editor
below is merit of vscode:
1) start up is very fast, better than eclipse, intellij, maybe same as sublime text (maybe vscode slower than sublim)

2) occupy lower memory, this is really important, my pc is 16GB, some time need develop server side, sometime need frontend, so i'll open many IDE, and open many chrome tab, when i use webstorm, my memory usually alert full, it's better now after change to vscode

3) built debug, such a small, fast software, and it like a real IDE can debug, so cool

4) intelliSense, massive extensions, many function can implement by install extension
